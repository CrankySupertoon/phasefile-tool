# ❓ What is Phasefile Tool
Phasefile Tool is a simple script to help automate the compilation and decompilation of Panda3D MultiFiles

This app is really useful for people to make "Toontown Content Packs" without the full SDK.

This app comes bundled with multify.exe and the correct DLLs as well as a noob proof batch script for little to no confusion.

# 🖍 Usage

## 💻 Windows
To use this tool simply run the **Phasefile.bat** file after moving your DNA files into the project.

## 🐧 Linux
